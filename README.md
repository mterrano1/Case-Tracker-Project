## Description

This is a case tracker application that allows customers to file a complaint. The complaint is automatically assigned to the manager with the fewest cases assigned to them. That manager can then assign the case to a researcher who can disposition the case once they're done researching it. The manager can view details about all of the cases that have been filed by accessing their dashboard page.

multi-service case tracker application using React, Rails, Flask, and PostgreSQL. Implemented validations and JWT authentication in both servers. Utilized Docker-Compose in development environment and Kubernetes for production environment. Deployed to AWS EKS using Terraform to provision VPC, Subnets, and Nginx ingress controller. Used Route 53 to configure DNS and utilized RDS for the Postgres databases
